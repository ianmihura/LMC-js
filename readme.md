# Little Man Computer
> The Little Man Computer (LMC) is an instructional model of a computer, created by Dr. Stuart Madnick in 1965. The LMC is generally used to teach students, because it models a simple von Neumann architecture computerâ€”which has all of the basic features of a modern computer. It can be programmed in machine code (albeit in decimal rather than binary) or assembly code.

### Execution
Load the `index.html` into any web browser. For now, the only way to interact with it is through the console. Open the devtools and do the following
1. Load the `Memory` array with the appropriate code.
   `Memory = [901, ...]`
   The program will attempt to translate the human-readable code to machine code.
2. Load the `Inputs` array with your inputs - will read from left to right.
   `Inputs = [1, 2, 3]`
   Memory has a limit of 99 places.
   Don't worry about filling the unused addresses - they will be filled for you.
   You can check out a couple of examples in the `examples.js`
3. Execute `Startup()`

### Other features
* Translate from aliased and indexed human redable to source code.
   Check the `examples.js` to understand the different indexing types.
